/** Linux SSH Configuration **

From Joel - Edit /home/username/.ssh/config

Host *
 StrictHostKeyChecking no
 ControlMaster auto
 ControlPath /tmp/.ssh/%r@%h:%p

You have to make sure /tmp/.ssh exists, or set it to some other dir.

What this does is:

1. the first connection opens a master socket to the destination (which takes the usual 2-10 seconds)
2. subsequent connections reuse the same master socket (connect time close to 0)

However: when all connections close, the master closes. So to make this work effectively, I use at least two terminal windows. In one window, I invoke ssh and leave that running. In the other windows I use ssh, sftp, svn, or whatever.

From John - Edit /home/username/.subversion/config

[tunnels]
...
# ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh -q -o ControlMaster=no
ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh -o ControlMaster=auto
