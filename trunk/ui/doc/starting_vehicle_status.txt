// ** Setup **

1.  Put "export Tilcon=/usr/Tilcon" into /<user>/.bashrc
    type "source" after editing the .bashrc
    ln -s .bashrc .bash_profile (might be the other way around on the arguments)

	We're not sure if the above command is just for compile or also for runtime, 
	but it can't hurt to have it global for all users.

2.  Launch /home/nt-onboard/test/vehicle_status -c car -e experiment
	-c options include "altima" or "audi"
	-d domain	
	-f main_window_file
	-i main_window_id
	-e options include
		default: none
		ntsafety
	-p twd_dir_full_path
		default is gnome: /home/nt-onboard/ui/twd/gnome
		for kde use: /home/nt-onboard/ui/twd/kde
	-v verbose

3.  See /home/nt-onboard/system_setup/INSTALL.checklist (Section 13) 
    for instruction on getting a tilcon app to run on startup.
