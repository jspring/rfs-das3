/* Documentation on how to get video out from the RCA jack on the J7F2

The Jetway J7F2 Motherboards use a VIA VT 1622A TV Encoder.

1.  There are jumpers on the motherboard to select video out of the RCA or
	or out of the S-Video.  You can also choose this in the BIOS, but we've
	only tried the RCA with the RCA jumper set.
	
2.	To enable video through the RCA jack, you need to go into the BIOS:
	"Advanced Chipset Features"
		"AGP Timing Settings"
			"Select Display Device" -> "CRT + TV" or "TV"
			"TV_Type" -> NTSC
			"TV_Connector" -> CVBS = RCA Jack
	
	Selecting CRT+TV will output to both the VGA and the RCA jack, However,
	some monitors may have an issue with CRT+TV mode and give you an input
	range error.  No idea how to fix that beyond forcing a resolution of 
	640x480.  Supposedly you can do this in the LILO bootloader.
	
3.	Copy xorg.conf-engineering to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

4.  When you startx use one of the following the command:
	
	startx -- -layout TVOUT
	startx -- -screen NTSC
	
5.	You can probably output video at up to 1024x768 to the RCA jack and the 
	chip will do the downscaling.  Actual NTSC video is really on the order of
	320x240 after you remove the interlacing, so the closer you stay to 
	640x480 on the output, the more readable it will be after Zu encodes it.
	
6.  In the NT project, the RCA Out on the Engineering computer is wired to 
	one of the video inputs being recorded by the Video computer.
