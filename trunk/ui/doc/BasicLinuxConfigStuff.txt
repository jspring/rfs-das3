/* Documentation on how to add a user in linux and configure SVN */

1.	From a root prompt:
	adduser username
		Hit enter to answer the questions - most defaults are fine.
		You must fill in something for the "Real Name" field.
		Give it a password.
		
2.  Edit /home/username/.bashrc to add the following commands:
		umask 2
		export SVNURL=svn+ssh://username@gateway.path.berkeley.edu/var/svn/rfs
		export SVN_EDITOR=/usr/bin/pico (or vi)
		export CAPATH_MK_DEFS=/home/path/build/capath_lnx.mk
		export Tilcon="/usr/Tilcon"

3.  usermod -g users username


/* Linux Enable sudo */
Edit /etc/sudoers

# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	ALL
%users	ALL=(ALL)	ALL


/* Linux SSH Configuration */

From Joel - Edit /home/username/.ssh/config

Host *
 StrictHostKeyChecking no
 ControlMaster auto
 ControlPath /tmp/.ssh/%r@%h:%p

You have to make sure /tmp/.ssh exists, or set it to some other dir.

What this does is:

1. the first connection opens a master socket to the destination (which takes the usual 2-10 seconds)
2. subsequent connections reuse the same master socket (connect time close to 0)

However: when all connections close, the master closes. So to make this work effectively, I use at least two terminal windows. In one window, I invoke ssh and leave that running. In the other windows I use ssh, sftp, svn, or whatever.

From John - Edit /home/username/.subversion/config

[tunnels]
...
# ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh -q -o ControlMaster=no
ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh -o ControlMaster=auto
