Advantec KPC-DNR700NHB Camera Setup

The KPC-DRN700 cameras, first used in the CACC Infiniti M56's, have a number
of advanced features that are accessed using the joystick on the back of the 
camera and an onscreen menu.

The optimal configuration will differ between Driver (Interior) and Road Scene
(Exterior) cameras.  Once a camera is configured, we should label it "D" for
interior and E for exterior.

Start with doing a factor reset (8).  Then you should just need to adjust the 
settings that are indicated with an "*".
