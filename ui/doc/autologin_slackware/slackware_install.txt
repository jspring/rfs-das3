/* Documentation on how to do the following:
 *
 * 1. Autologin a non-root user at startup
 * 2. Get that user to automatically startx on the screen
 * 3. Get a tilcon program to start up automatically
 *
 * This method will run the tilcon app in a user space from boot
 * so that it will not take up massive amounts of cpu time.
 * 
 * The slackware_autologin.pdf file gives the basics of how to do
 * this from a website.  The instructions here make corrections.

	13.0 cp /home/das3/ui/doc/xorg.conf-engineering /etc/X11/xorg.conf

	13.1 If tilcon user does not exist, from root: adduser tilcon

	13.2 Edit autologin.c to use the desired username (if not tilcon)
    		Compile autologin.c "gcc -o autologin autologin.c"
    		As root: chown root:root autologin
			 cp autologin /usr/local/sbin

	13.3 As root: edit /etc/inittab to look like what follows:
		# Default runlevel. (Do not set to 0 or 6)
		id:3:initdefault:
		#x:3:once:/bin/su root -l -c "/bin/bash --login -c /usr/bin/startx >/dev/null 2>&1"

		# These are the standard console login getties in multiuser mode:
		# c1:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux
		c1:235:respawn:/sbin/agetty -n -l /usr/local/sbin/autologin 38400 tty1 linux

	13.4 As root: edit /etc/login.defs to look like what follows:
		# If defined, either full pathname of a file containing device names or
		# a ":" delimited list of device names. No password is required to log
		# in as a non-root user on these devices.
		#
		#NO_PASSWORD_CONSOLE tty1:tty2:tty3:tty4:tty5:tty6
		NO_PASSWORD_CONSOLE tty1

	13.5 Edit the tilcon users /home/tilcon/.bash_profile
		 Include the following:
		 
		 export Tilcon=/usr/Tilcon
   		
		 Thenâ
		
		 ln -s .bash_profile .bashrc

	13.6 Reboot the computer.  At the end of the reboot, you should be logged 
		 into a shell as the user tilcon.
		 
		 - Type startx in order to create kde preferences & .kde/Autostart
		 - Quit the calendar and clipboard apps on the menu bar
		 - Set those apps to no longer autostart
		 - Right click on the desktop & disable screensaver
		 - Disable KDE Startup and Shutdown sounds in
		   K Menu>Settings>Sounds and Multimedia>System Notifications

	13.7 Edit /home/das3/ui/doc/start_tilcon.sh:

		If this car is an Altima, do nothing.

		If this car is an Audi, replace 

		"... -c altima..."

		with	

		"... -c audi..."
	
	13.8 cp /home/das3/ui/doc/start_tilcon.sh /home/tilcon/.kde/Autostart

	13.9 Log out of X, startx again.  An xterm will launch, but vehicle_status 
		 may still fail to launch. If so, log out of X, startx again, and this 
		 time the vehicle_status tilcon screen should come up. Else, try again.
		 Once it's up, do the following:
		 
		- K Menu>Settings>KDE Components>Session Manager -> "Restore manually saved session"
		- K Menu>Save Session

	13.10 Edit the tilcon user's /home/tilcon/.bash_profile to include 
		  the following:
		
		  if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] && [ $(tty) == "/dev/vc/1" ]; then
			  startx
		  fi
