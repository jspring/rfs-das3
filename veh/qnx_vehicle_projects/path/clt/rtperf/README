This directory contains sample code for calculating round trip UDP delays,
for synchronizing clock between two systems, and for reading GPS information
and writing it to a file.

Versions of this code have been used on the GM CVS project and with
the Denso WAVE Radio modules, using the wl library.

To some extent this duplicates the performance testing that can be
done by utilities like iperf and ping, but has the advantage of
being a small body of code that is easy to understand, modify and
instrument for different environments and includes estimates of
round-trip delay and clock skew between systems as well as throughput.
The output format is line by line trace, not summary, but it is easy to
write scripts to get summary.

The version here is designed to have no dependencies on code other than
the libraries in /home/path/local.

To calculate round-trip delays:
Start rt_rcv on the remote system.
Start rt_mtr on the local system.
Start rt_snd on the local system.

On the local system, run for example:

rt_mtr >mtr.dat &
rt_snd -a 192.168.20.1 -t 100 -n 1000 -m 500

-t is 100 milliseconds between sends
-n 1000 is 1000 messages sent
-m is the number of bytes per packet

To set clock on a remote system (to match local system):
On the remote system run (with root permission):
clock_set -m 1
-m = max updates before exiting (default 1. Make sure this number is <= n in
clock_snd_skew, or you'll never exit)
ON the local system run:
clock_snd_skew  -a 192.168.20.1 -t 100 -n 100
