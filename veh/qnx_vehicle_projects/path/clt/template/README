This directory contains code fragments that need to be added or
changed in order to port from QNX to Linux using the database.

There is a change in the signal handling, see sig_d (declarations)
and sig_x (exit environment within body of code).

The clt_login call must now include COMM_PSX_XPORT as the xport 
parameter, as opposed to COMM_QNX_XPORT on QNX4 and don't care on QNX6.
This call must also have the domain (or service, as it is called within
the database source) set to the base file name for the files that will
be created for each process's queue.
