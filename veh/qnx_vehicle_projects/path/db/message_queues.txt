There are three parameters in /proc/sys/kernel that affect the behavior
of Posix message queues, here are the values we have seen on some of our
systems:

msgmni	max queues system wide = 16
msgmax	max size of message (bytes) = 8192
msgmnb	default max size of queue (bytes) = 16384

If you have more than 16 processes using the data server, you may have
trouble with the first one. To fix this, as root,

# cd /proc/sys/kernel
# echo 64 > msgmni

and see if that helps. If it does, you should add the line

# echo 64 >/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni

to /etc/rc.local so that it will be set up that way every time the system
reboots.

You may also have to change the other parameters. MAX_DATA_SIZE is 128
bytes, the actual size put in the POSIX message queue for each data
variable read/write request is larger than that. If you have 64 processes
accessing db_slv at once for read or write, that will be at least 2^13
or 8192 bytes.  Write a test program that prints DB_COMM_SIZE to find out
how much overhead there is per data variable, and make sure the expected
number of processes accessing the data server times DB_COMM_SIZE does
not exceed msgmnb.
