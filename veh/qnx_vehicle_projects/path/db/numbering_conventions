In older code under QNX for demo 97 and transit projects, a numbering
scheme like the one below for transit signal priority  was used, and
each project declared its own database variables.
*  0    to 99     Used by the system.
 *  100  to 199    Reserved.
 *  200  to 349    Permanent variables used to store bus-specific data
 *  350  to 549    Permanent variables used to store signal-specific data
 *  550  to 849    Permanent variables used to store priority-specific data
 *  850  to 949   Permanent variables used to store other signal-specific data  
 *  950  to 989   Permanent variables used to store stretch data        ^M
 *  1000 to 1099   Temporary variables.

Now that we are using more shared code across projects, we will continue
to use numbers under 1000 for code that is not shared, but if your
code will be used with code written by other projects, you will need
to pick a number over 1000 as your base.

Currently the following bases over 1000 are in use:
3000 is being used as the base by the Actuated Traffic Signal Controller code.
5000 is being used as the base by the radar code.
7000 is being used as the base by the Adaptive Transit Signal Priority code.
8000 is being used as the base by the GPS code.

Need to assign numbering and adjust video and ibeo.
