This directory contains the source code for the database server process,
db_slv and the database library libdb_clts.a.

To build a clean copy of these programs from source on your system:

As an ordinary user, type
make clean
make

Become root and type
setuid.sh

You should not need to change any files in this directory (other than
to rebuild to make sure you are in sync with your system's libraries.)

If you find a bug, please report to 
Sue Dickey, dickey@path.berkeley.edu
and
Tom Kuhn, tmk@path.berkeley.edu

See the directory ../clt for test programs to help you get started
using the database.

See the file implementation notes in this directory if you want to
understand more about porting this software from QNX4 to Linux.
See message_queues.txt for information about setting parameters that
affect the data server performance on Linux.

See the file numbering_conventions for how to define database variables used
in your project so that they are shared when needed and don't conflict with
other projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
July 2008 Tom Kuhn has completed port of this code to QNX6.
