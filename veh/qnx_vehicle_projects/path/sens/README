This directory is for drivers/parsers for sensors that are likely to
be shared across projects.

The drivers should be written so that they can be used either with
the data server, or without it to get a trace, by changing a command
line flag.

All structures and data server definitions needed by the sensor driver
should be contained in the associated header file.

Data server variable definitions must be take from a range that
does not conflict with any project.
