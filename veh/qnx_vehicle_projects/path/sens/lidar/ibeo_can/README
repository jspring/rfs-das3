This code was written by Sue Dickey in 2005 for the early version
of the IBEO Laser Scanner using the CAN interface. It worked briefly,
until the device started having problems, running on QNX4 and QNX6.
It depends on the ssv_can driver developed for the JBUS code for 
Demo2003 for the CAN messaging facility.
