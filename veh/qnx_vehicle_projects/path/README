This is the top-level directory of the California PATH shared code
distribution, which is kept under Subversion version control on
the PATH server.

To build the code in this tree using make.

1) Look in the 'build' subdirectory of this directory, and edit
capath_lnx.mk, if you are on a Linux system, capath_qnx.mk if you
are on a QNX6 system, or capath_sobos.make, if you are using the
Sobos embedded cross-compile for the Savari on-board unit, to set
DISTRIB_DIR to the parent directory where you have checked out this
"path" subdirectory. (The parent directory is used so that project
files in a "sister" directory may use the same make include file
and build mechanisms to link to the California PATH shared code. 

2) Set up the environment variable CAPATH_MK_DEFS to contain the
location of this file on your system, for example, on a Linux system,
where you have done

% svn co $SVNURL/path/trunk /home/capath/path

do

% export CAPATH_MK_DEFS=/home/capath/path/build/capath_lnx.mk

You will probably want to put this command in your profile, unless
you often switch from native to cross-compile. On QNX6, the commands
are the same as for Linux. If you need to do the Sobos cross-compile,
you will need more information than is in this README.  

3) Check the Makefile to see if you want to turn on builds of the
Tilcon or mtcp directories by uncommenting those lines. You may 
also comment out the build of the "sens" directory if you only need
that DB data server and do not use any of the drivers or the GPS
utility functions.


4) Type 'make' in this directory to build the subtrees. On Sobos,
make setup will copy a Makefile into the parent directory for using
a package. On Linux and QNX6, make setup copies a stub Makefile in
the parent directory in case you want to build a top-level Makefile
that builds both the project-specific files and the shared code.
